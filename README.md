Django Steganography Project
This project implements a web-based application using Django for performing steganography on image, audio, and video files. Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message.

ðŸŒŸ **Features**

**Image Steganography**: Embed secret messages into image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and extract them.

**Audio Steganography**: Embed secret messages into audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3) and extract them.

**Video Steganography**: Embed secret messages into video files (e.g., MP4) and extract them.

**User-friendly Web Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface for uploading files and performing steganography operations.

**File Handling**: Secure handling of uploaded and processed files.

ðŸš€ **Technologies Used**


**Backend**: Django (Python Web Framework)

**Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL Fork) or similar libraries for image manipulation.

**Audio Processing**: pydub or scipy.io.wavfile for audio file manipulation.

**Video Processing**: moviepy or OpenCV (for frame extraction/reconstruction) for video file manipulation.

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS (React CSS for styling), JavaScript.

**Database**: SQLite (default Django) for development, configurable for production.
